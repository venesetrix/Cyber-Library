# GCP Cloud Digital Leader Cert Prep Notes

## Digital Transformation with Google Cloud

Digital transformation = Using cloud platforms to create or modify business processes, culture and customer experiences to meet the needs of changing business and market dynamics.

The cloud = A metaphor for the network of data centers which store and compute information thatâ€™s available through the internet.

Digital transformation is...
* an ongoing process, not a one-time effort.
* more than simply migrating and shifting systems to the cloud for cost saving and convenience.

Cloud usage models:

* On-Premises - "No Cloud"
* Private Cloud - "Cloud hosted only for me"
* Public Cloud - "Cloud hosted seperately but for everyone"

## Foundational Cloud Concepts

### Total cost of ownership (TCO)

TCO analysis mean to compare On-Premise investments for infrastructure and operating with cloud operation costs as well as predicting future expenditures.

### Capital Expenditures (CapEx) vs. Operating expenses (OpEx)

Shift from capital expenditure to operating expenses.

CapEx means huge upfront costs for servers, equipment and software. Typically this means budgeting once a year. It means also, that you have to presume in details changes in upcoming timeframes.

OpEx means, that you're paying for what you use. This means constant monitoring of expenses.

### Private cloud, hybrid cloud and multi-cloud strategies

* Private cloud - Own or dedicated provider. Used, when there has already been large upfront investments or for compliance reasons.
* Hybrid cloud - On-Prem and one or Public cloud provider like Google. Most-Used.
* Multi-Cloud - Two or more Public cloud providers to use the key stengths of the different providers. 
  * Gartner: "81% of organizations are working with two or more public cloud providers
  * Flexera: "93% of enterprises have a multicloud strategy."
  * Benefits:
    * Access to the latest technologies of all cloud providers.
    * Modernize at the right pace
    * Improved return on investments
    * Flexibility through choice of tools
    * Avoid vendor lock-in's
    * Improve reliability and resiliency
    * Maintain regulatory compliance
    * Running apps at remote edge locations

### Cloud networking

__Network performance__

* Bandwidth = Measure of how much data a network can transfer in a given amount of time
* Latency = Amount of time it takes for data to travel from one point to another

__Google Cloud regions and zones__

7 Major locations:

* North America
* South America
* Europe
* Middle East
* Africa
* Asia
* Australia

A region comprises of zones. For example the Region europe-west2 comprises 3 different zones (europe-west2-a, europe-west2-b, europe-west2-c). Some services are in a "Multi-Region" construct like Cloud Storage which is in the Multi-Region called "Europe" and comprises London and Belgium for Geo-Redundancy.

__Google's edge network__

Network edge = Entry point to the network.

## Cloud Computing Models and Shared Responsibility

### Cloud Computing service models

| Model | Name | Benefits | Tradeoffs | Example Products |
| :---: | :--- | :------- | :-------- | :------- |
| IaaS | Infrastructure as a service | Provides Compute, Storage, Database and Network services. You lease the resources and pay only what you use. Saves procurement processes, physical spaces and CapEx. | Need to install and maintain software and OS. | **_Cloud Compute_**, **_Cloud Storage_** |
| PaaS | Platform as a service | No need to build and maintain the associated infrastructure and test the environments. Can use built-in software components. | Limited set of Platforms and Flexibility in Comparison to IaaS | **_Cloud Run_**, **_BigQuery_** |
| SaaS | Software as a service | Abstracts technology completely from the consumer. Only pay subscription fees. All technical issues are out-sourced. | Clear boundaries of usage. Only supports standard software solutions. | **_Google Workspace_** |

### Shared responsiblity model

Some security aspects are given to the cloud provider. The Cloud provider is responsible for the Security OF the Cloud and the customer is responsible for the Security IN the Cloud.

Gartner says that "99% of all cloud security failures will result from user error" ("Is the Cloud Secure?", Gartner, 2019).

General rule: If you configure or store it, you're responsible for securing it.

## The value of data

### Types of data

| Type| Description | Example |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| Structured Data | Highly organized and well-defined. Typically stored in a table. Easy to analyze | Spreadsheet or database |
| Semi-Structured Data | Organized into a hierarchy. Doesn't have a formal structure. Without full differentiation or order. | Emails, HTML, JSON, XML |
| Unstructured data | Doesn't have a predefined data model. | Text, Images, Audio, Video, Performance data. Can be analyzed via Maschine Learning and API i.e. **_Cloud Vision API_**. |

### Data Management Concepts

| Type| Description | Purpose of Use |

There are four storage classes:

| Storage class | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| Hot data | Frequently accessed. |
| Nearline Storage | Infrequently accessed/Once per month like data archiving or backup. |
| Coldline Storage | Infrequently accessed/Once every 90 days. |
| Archive Storage | Access once a year for archiving. This is the cheapest option. Has a 365-day minimum storage duration. |

There's a feature called "Autoclass" which automatically transitions objects to appropriate storage classes based on each object's access pattern.
