## Foundational Cloud Concepts

### Total cost of ownership (TCO)

TCO analysis mean to compare On-Premise investments for infrastructure and operating with cloud operation costs as well as predicting future expenditures.

### Capital Expenditures (CapEx) vs. Operating expenses (OpEx)

Shift from capital expenditure to operating expenses.

CapEx means huge upfront costs for servers, equipment and software. Typically this means budgeting once a year. It means also, that you have to presume in details changes in upcoming timeframes.

OpEx means, that you're paying for what you use. This means constant monitoring of expenses.

### Private cloud, hybrid cloud and multi-cloud strategies

* Private cloud - Own or dedicated provider. Used, when there has already been large upfront investments or for compliance reasons.
* Hybrid cloud - On-Prem and one or Public cloud provider like Google. Most-Used.
* Multi-Cloud - Two or more Public cloud providers to use the key stengths of the different providers. 
  * Gartner: "81% of organizations are working with two or more public cloud providers
  * Flexera: "93% of enterprises have a multicloud strategy."
  * Benefits:
    * Access to the latest technologies of all cloud providers.
    * Modernize at the right pace
    * Improved return on investments
    * Flexibility through choice of tools
    * Avoid vendor lock-in's
    * Improve reliability and resiliency
    * Maintain regulatory compliance
    * Running apps at remote edge locations

### Cloud networking

__Network performance__

* Bandwidth = Measure of how much data a network can transfer in a given amount of time
* Latency = Amount of time it takes for data to travel from one point to another

__Google Cloud regions and zones__

7 Major locations:

* North America
* South America
* Europe
* Middle East
* Africa
* Asia
* Australia

A region comprises of zones. For example the Region europe-west2 comprises 3 different zones (europe-west2-a, europe-west2-b, europe-west2-c). Some services are in a "Multi-Region" construct like Cloud Storage which is in the Multi-Region called "Europe" and comprises London and Belgium for Geo-Redundancy.

## Scaling with Google Cloud Operations

### Fundamentals of cloud financial governance

To manage cloud costs effectively, a partnership across finance, technology, and business functions is required. The central team would consist of several experts who ensure that best practices are in place across the organization and that there's visibility into the ongoing cloud spend. **_Center of excellence_** is a centralized hub within an organization for that.

On a daily or weekly basis, organizations should monitor and analyze their cloud usage and costs. Then, on a weekly or monthly basis, the finance team should analyze the results, charge back the costs through the appropriate teams, and determine whether any changes are needed to ensure that the organization's cloud spend is optimized.

### Cloud financial governance best practices

* Identify who manage cloud costs.
  * Defining clear ownership for projects.
  * Sharing cost views with the departments and teams that are using cloud resources.
  * Creating multiple budgets with meaningful alerts.
* Understand invoices versus cost management tools
  * An invoice is a document that is sent by a cloud service provider to a customer to request payment for the services that were used.
  * A cost management tool is software to help track, analyze, and optimize cloud spend.
* Use Google Cloud's cost management tools
  * Capture what cloud resources are being used, by whom, for what purpose, and at what cost.
  * Determine who will be responsible for monitoring that information, who will be involved in managing costs, and how the spending information will be reported on an ongoing basis.
  * Set up the cadence and format for ongoing communication with main cloud stakeholders.

The **_Pricing Calculator_** lets you estimate how changes to cloud usage will affect costs. **Link:** [Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator)

### Using the resource hierarchy to control access

The **_Google Cloud resource hierarchy_** is a powerful tool that can be used to control access to cloud resources. 

Google Cloudâ€™s resource hierarchy contains four levels, and starting from the bottom up they are:

1. Resources
2. Projects
3. Folders
4. Organization node

A policy is a set of rules that define who can access a resource an what they can do with it. Policies can be defined on levels 2 to 4. Some services can even add policies on resource level.

### Controlling cloud consumtion

Google Cloud offers several tools to help control cloud consumption:

* **_Resource quota policies_** - Set limits on the amount of resources that can be used by a project or user.
* **_Budget threshold rules_** - Set alerts to be informed when your cloud costs exceed a certain threshold.

## Operational Excellence and Reliability at Scale

### Fundamentals of cloud reliability

DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration and communication between development and operations teams to enhance the efficiency, speed, and reliability of software delivery.

One particular concept within the DevOps framework is **_Site Reliability Engineering_**, or SRE, which ensures the reliability, availability, and efficiency of software systems and services deployed in the cloud.

Monitoring is the foundation of product reliability. There are "Four Golden Signals" that measure a systems's performance and reliability:

| Signal | Description |
| :----- | :----- |
| Latency | Measures how long it takes for a particular part of a system to return a result. |
| Traffic | Measures how many requests reach your system. |
| Saturation | Measures how close to capacity a system is. |
| Errors | Events that measure system failures or other issues. |

Three main concepts in site reliability engineering are:

| Concept | Abbreviation | Description |
| :----- | :-----: | :----- |
| Service-level indicators  | SLI | Measurements that show how well a system or service is performing. |
| Service-level objectives  | SLO | The goals that we set for a system's performance based on SLIs. |
| Service-level agreements  | SLA | Agreements between a cloud service provider and its customers. They outline the promises and guarantees regarding the quality of service. |

### Designing resilient infrastructure and processes

Key design considerations:

| Consideration | Description | Advantages | 
| :----- | :----- | :----- |
| Redundancy | Duplicating critical components or resources to provide backup alternatives. | Enhances system reliability and mitigates the impact of single points of failure. |
| Replication | Creating multiple copies of data or services and distributing them across different servers or locations. | Ensures redundancy and fault tolerance by allowing systems to continue functioning even if certain components or servers fail. |
| Regions | Distributing resources across regions. | Improves resilience and reduces the risk of prolonged service interruptions. |
| Scalable infrastructure | Dynamic allocation and deallocation of resources based on workload fluctuations by autoscaling mechanisms. | Ensuring that services remain available and responsive during peak periods or sudden spikes in traffic. |
| Backups | Regular backups of critical data and configurations. | Ensure that if data loss, hardware failures, or cyber-attacks occur, organizations can restore their systems to a previous state. |
